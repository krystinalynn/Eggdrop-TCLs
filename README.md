# Eggdrop TCLs
I don't own all of these TCLs. I did not create all of them. The ones I haven't created will be prefixed with [*]

## [*] Eva.tcl
This is a P10 protocol script for Eggdrop. It requires a uline connect block in ircu. When the bot is launched, it attempts to make a second connection through a socket to the server on the u:line port. This second connection is linked as a u:lined service and can perform actions that an ordinary eggdrop cannot.
